            Khaled's experience
            <br>
            I have been proud to be a part of the CIB Summer Program. We learned about the importance of data literacy and other subjects like the importance of a CV and risk management and how to start your own business.
            <br><br>
            This was an engaging journey with lots of competitions. Although this program wasn't related to my profession, it was a fun experience.
