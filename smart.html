                The smart cone pencil case is a device that allows users to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean</li>
                    <li>See in the darkness</li>
                    <li>Count the number of pencils currently inside this cone pencil case</li>
                    <li>Solve Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</li>
                    <li>Make users less freaked out from using other peopleâ€™s pencils since they can clean them before use</li>
                </ul>
